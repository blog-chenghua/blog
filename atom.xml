Fighting in the densely populated strip will exact a steep humanitarian toll that could sway global public opinion against Israel and draw sympathisers elsewhere in the region into the fray, Hamas hopes.</p><p>Above all, notes Hamas’s military spokesman, it holds <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/08/israeli-hostages-now-face-a-terrifying-ordeal">more than 100 Israeli hostages</a> who would be at as great a risk from an Israeli offensive as Palestinian civilians. It intends to use them as bargaining chips to secure a mass release of Palestinian prisoners and to end Israel’s blockade. “Negotiations have already started through the Egyptians,” says a Hamas official. And, notes an Israeli mediator, referring to the captured Israeli soldier Hamas exchanged for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011, the price they will seek to exact now will be higher because “they have a hundred Gilad Shalits.” Hamas has said they will execute one hostage for each unannounced Israeli strike on homes in Gaza (though the hostages are valuable bargaining chips).</p><p>Before the latest attack Israel and Hamas had fought four major wars and had a number of smaller clashes since the Islamist group took control of Gaza and its 2m people in 2007. These cost thousands of lives, most of them Palestinian. But since the end of a two-week-long battle in 2021, Hamas has avoided escalating the conflict and has indeed restrained other Palestinian militants when they fired rockets into Israel. Many Israelis believed the Islamist group was more interested in maintaining a ceasefire in order to focus on rebuilding the impoverished and overcrowded coastal strip than in sparking another bloody and pointless war. The Israeli government hoped that allowing thousands of Palestinian labourers to work in Israel so long as calm prevailed would provide a further incentive to keep the peace. And some officials hoped that Hamas itself could be co-opted into a long-term truce. Its brutal attack on October 7th shattered that illusion. “Once a terrorist group, always a terrorist group,” says Yaakov Amidror, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFpXTFOKWI0" height="360" width="100%" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"></iframe><p>For some time there have been signs that Israel might have been misreading the situation in Gaza. For years, Israeli officials have shrugged off warnings that living conditions in the enclave were so dire that the frustrations they caused could spark an explosion. When Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, it was hoped that the territory would be able to export produce into Egypt and Israel and import goods through a border crossing with Egypt. But since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 the territory has been under a blockade by both countries that has constrained trade, strangled its economy and largely confined its people.</p><p>Adding to those grievances was a sense in Gaza of abandonment by the wider world. Earlier this summer Qatar, which had been sending Hamas $30m a month to pay the salaries of public servants among other things, cut the payments to $10m a month. Even that often arrived late. (“If you’re trying to pay your way out of resistance, you better pay and pay the maximum,” says an interlocutor shuttling between Hamas and Western governments.) The Abraham accords, which established diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, added to Gazans’ feeling of suffering alone. “We’ve decided to put an end to all this,” said Muhammad Deif, the military wing’s commander, in a communiqué announcing the attack. “So that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account.”</p><p>The Islamists are also seeking to change things far beyond Gaza. “We want to spark rebellion” in the occupied West Bank, said a Hamas official, both against Mahmoud Abbas, the ailing president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), and Israel, which props up the PA. Hamas also aims to return the issue of Palestine to the top of the Middle East’s political agenda. In Lebanon’s Palestinian refugee camps, visitors report a carnival atmosphere. In Egypt’s second city, Alexandria, a policeman shot dead two Israeli tourists. And Hamas hopes to spark a wider conflict by appealing for help from other members of the “axis of resistance”, as Iran and its satellites in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and the Houthi-run part of Yemen like to call themselves.</p><p>Yet it is far from clear that the other members of that axis will be enthusiastic about joining the fight. Hizbullah, the party-cum-militia in Lebanon, has a huge arsenal of rockets aimed at Israel. But the bitter war it fought with Israel in 2006 was so destructive that Hizbullah has refrained since then from starting another one. And Lebanon, with its collapsing economy, is in no shape to deal with another calamity. Hizbullah’s patron, Iran, also seems to want it to keep its satellite’s powder dry; the thousands of rockets it has provided to Hizbullah are intended to deter Israel from bombing Iran’s nuclear programme. And for all its rhetoric, Iran has never gone to war for the Palestinians. “We know we’re a tool [of Iran],” says the Gaza official, noting that Hamas and Iran lie on opposite sides of Islam’s sectarian divide between Shias and Sunnis. “At the end of day we just have a <em>zawaj muta’</em>, a temporary marriage.”</p><p>In an attempt to avoid opening another front, Israeli officials have played down the role of Iran and Hizbullah. But the axis has done little to disguise its gloating at Israel and support for Hamas. On October 9th the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> quoted two unnamed officials from Iran and Hizbullah saying that the Islamic Republic had plotted the attack for weeks. It noted that Ismail Qaani, the head of the foreign arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, had repeatedly met with Hizbullah’s leaders and Hamas officials, including Saleh al-Arouri, its representative in Beirut, ahead of the attack. Yet this version of events probably overstates Iran’s role. Although Hamas gets arms and training from Iran, the Palestinian group insists that it alone decides whether and when to launch operations. In any case, it had many reasons of its own for attacking.</p><p>Iran’s main concern is that the region is slipping out of its orbit into America’s and Israel’s. Saudi Arabia and Israel have both said publicly that they are taking steps towards establishing diplomatic relations and that these are being underwritten by security guarantees from America. Further progress was expected with the visit of a third Israeli cabinet minister to Riyadh later this month. Just days before this attack started Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that countries establishing relations with Israel were putting themselves “in harm’s way”.</p><p>Indeed, after a period of relative calm in the region, Iran’s allies are renewing hostilities on several fronts. The Houthis, the Shia armed group that controls Yemen’s capital, recently staged their first cross-border attack on Saudi Arabia for months. Militias aligned with Iran in eastern Syria have also lobbed rockets at American bases and encouraged Arab tribes in the region to rebel against local Kurdish control.</p><p>Still, pressure on other members of the axis to do more may increase as the fighting in Gaza intensifies. Two months ago Hizbullah conducted a much-hyped military exercise in southern Lebanon in which it practised capturing Israeli towns. That Hamas has now done so “puts them under pressure”, says Hilal Khashan, a Lebanese security expert. The day after Hamas launched its attack, Hizbullah shelled three Israeli positions on the Sheba’a farms, a parcel of contested land in the foothills of the Golan Heights. The location of this attack appears designed to assuage the movement’s hotheads, while also signalling to Israel that it wants to avoid escalation. The question is how long that complex calculation holds. ■</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center>小米电视系列系统优化教程</center><p>本教程旨在通过使用ADB（Android Debug Bridge）开发者工具包来卸载和更换小米电视系统预装的应用程序或系统组件，以减少系统资源占用，提高电视启动和响应速度，提供更纯粹的电视体验。以下是优化小米电视系统的基本步骤：</p><p><strong>说明：由于本教程没有对小米电视系统进行ROOT权限获取，也没有删除或更改系统关键进程，系统通常不会因为卸载应用程序或更改桌面环境而崩溃，但并不排除个人操作不当导致的问题，本网站或服务提供商将不承担由此引起的责任。</strong></p><p><strong>注意：这是一个高级操作，务必充分观看教程之后再操作，建议在进行操作之前备份重要数据，并在需要时恢复出厂设置。此外，要特别小心，不要禁用系统关键组件，以免造成不可修复的问题。</strong></p><p>1.<strong>准备工作：</strong></p><ul><li>用户需要一台计算机，并提前安装好ADB工具。ADB是Android开发工具包的一部分，用户可以从附件一中下载并解压到指定文件夹(尽量解压至磁盘根目录，例如<code>D://Xiaomi</code>)。</li><li>启用小米电视上的开发者选项：在电视的设置中，找到“关于电视”，然后多次点击“版本号”以解锁开发者选项。</li><li>启用小米电视上的开发者选项：在电视的设置中，找到“账号与安全”，将<strong>ADB调试</strong>设置为<strong>允许</strong>，将<strong>允许安装未知来源应用</strong>设置成<strong>允许</strong>。</li><li>下载第三方桌面：在这里，推荐使用纯净版的”当贝桌面”，用户可以从附件二中获取第三方桌面应用。</li></ul><p>2.<strong>连接电视：</strong></p><ul><li>保证电视和计算机处于同一个局域网之内。</li><li>打开电视设置-网络设置-选择连接的网络-记录下电视的IP地址(IPV4）。</li></ul><p>获取设备连接：</p><ul><li><p>以Windows系统为例，打开命令提示符，定位到附件一解压的文件夹位置，具体的操作步骤如下：</p><ol><li>打开CMD命令提示符。</li><li>在命令提示符中首先输入目标盘符命令，例如<code>D：</code>。</li><li>然后进入由附件一解压的文件夹，例如<code>cd: \Xiaomi</code>。</li><li>按回车键，即可进入该目录。</li></ol></li><li><p>运行ADB命令<code>adb connect 192.168.*.*</code>，其中192.168. * . * 为小米电视的IP地址。连接计算机，此时电视屏幕上会弹出一个提示框“允许USB调试吗？”，电视遥控器勾选<strong>一律允许。</strong></p></li><li><p>如果此步骤连接失败，那么需要将电视与计算机通过USB线连接，并确保USB调试选项在开发者选项中已启用，重新获取设备连接。</p></li><li><p>运行ADB命令<code>adb devices</code>来确认电视是否正确连接到计算机：</p></li><li><p>若命令行出现相关信息<code>List of devices attached</code>，则表示连接成功：</p></li></ul><p>3.<strong>小米电视系统初步优化：</strong></p><ul><li><p>根据下面代码，在命令行中按此推荐卸载系统自带软件，完成小米电视系统的局部优化，按回车键执行该行代码：</p><figure class="highlight scss"><table><tbody><tr><td
